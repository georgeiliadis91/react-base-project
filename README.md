# Base React App Template for Projects. 

This is a dockerised react dev enviroment that **hot reloads**.
It is bootstraped wtih create-react-app (CRA), in case you believe that CRA is too bloated (which is not anymore) and you want to customise it
you can always eject and mingle with the configuration manually.

It includes a base structure with Routing, Alert, User Auth Flows, Global Loading State, Redux and its Build. And most importantly Typescript.

Installed libraries:

- ReactRouter-v6
- Redux 
- React Redux
- History
- React Router Dom

It is ment to be a starting point for large projects. 

All you need is to execute the Dockerfile included. If you are using vscode, you can simply install [Remote Containers](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers). and choose Open in Container in the command palette.

More to come soon...
